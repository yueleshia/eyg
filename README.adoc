An implementation of the Eat Your Greens language by Peter Saxton.

EYG currently is unlicensed, but licensing is on the https://eyg.run/roadmap/[roadmap].

== Information

Different implementations of programming languages standardize on their syntax (the source code text), but EYG standardises on its AST.
Lexing/parsing (aka. converting to AST) is outsourced to implementations.
